# Urban Arts

### This is a project that was designed by 3 students of Athens University of Economics and Business. 
## Main Idea
The main idea behind the project is to create an android application (media type) that actually helps artists become known to more people, while also gives users the option to find any kind of art around them. (For example Graffities or some live events such as music performances.) Artists have profiles that users can follow to get information about the artists and users themselves can create posts either for live events that they came across happening or for pieces of art around the city that people may be intrested to find.
##### Here is a guide of the main usage of our application in Greek

For the completion of the project we used Android Studio and the database we are using is a firebase db. A noSql database that allows you to send requests for database data directly from the code.
